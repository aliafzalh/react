# React + Vite

# ðŸŒ¤ React Vite Weather App

A simple React app built with Vite that fetches real-time weather using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Netlify deployed
reactsba320.netlify.app

## API_KEY
The API_KEY is saved in the .env file and is not shared on GitHub for security reasons. As a result, the weather app works locally but does not work on Netlify unless the environment variable is also configured in the Netlify dashboard.



This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
